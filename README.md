# go-webservice1.0
test run for go webservices


This webservice allows for the addition of Users with ID to your locally hosted webserver through http requests, with built-in error handling.
The best way to utilize this webservice is through Postman, by sending a bunch of POST, PUT, DEL and GET requests to manipulate data.

Run ``` main.go ``` to start the api, running on port 3000.
